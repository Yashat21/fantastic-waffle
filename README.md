Emotion-Sensitive AI Voice Assistant
Project Overview
This project introduces an emotionally intelligent voice assistant that leverages Google Vertex AI, Groq, and Blockchain technology to provide context-aware, sentiment-driven, and secure interactions. Unlike conventional voice assistants, this system adapts its responses based on the user's emotional tone, creating a more human-like and empathetic experience.

Key Features
Emotion Detection & Sentiment Analysis – Uses NLP models to analyze user tone and adjust responses accordingly.

Multilingual Support – Trained on Google Vertex AI, allowing seamless interaction in multiple languages.

Fast AI Processing – Groq AI accelerates neural network computations for real-time responses.

Secure Communication – Blockchain integration ensures data privacy and secure transactions.

Cloud-Based Infrastructure – Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and efficiency.

Technologies Used
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning – Google Vertex AI, Deep Learning Models

Cloud & Data Management – Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Blockchain Integration

Programming & Frameworks – Python, Chainlit, Groq API, PyHT

Future Scope
Future enhancements include integration with AR glasses and virtual environments to enable more immersive and interactive AI-driven user experiences.
